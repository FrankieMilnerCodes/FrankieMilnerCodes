## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am an Atlanta native that has provided exceptional service over the last 12 years from classics like Fox Bros to Ray's on the River. I use my degree in English from Georgia State every single day but that is not why you are here. I needed a bigger challenge that would keep me forever suspended in learning and growth; naturally, I chose Software Development. I am currently attending Fullstack Academy's Bootcamp for Coding and graduate August 9th, 2024! Yes, I am desperately seeking opportunities! 
I am also completing my second Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Middle Georgia State University. 
Through this journey, I have realized that I am happiest with a company that promotes continuous growth but equally important, that the company gives back to the community as often as possible! I would love to lead outreach programs with my forever company!

I am just a girl, standing in front of a company, asking them to hire her. 

(if you know, let's be friends!)
